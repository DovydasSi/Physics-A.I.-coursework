# Physics-A.I.-coursework
Simple game for my Physics and AI coursework

The game includes basic menu UI that uses Pushdown Automata, two types of simple enemy AI, structure generation from file, pathfinding, collectables, position constraints between objects, and other features.  

All of the code in the "CSC8503/" directory is written by me, excluding GameTechRenderer, GameTechVulkanRendere, NetworkedPlayer, NetworkedGame, and TutorialGame files. Those were provided for us.

The rest of the codebase is mostly the game engine code that has been given to us with some performance improvements written by me.
